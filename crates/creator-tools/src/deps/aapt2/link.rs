/// ## Link
/// In the link phase, AAPT2 merges all the intermediate files generated from the
/// compilation phase such as resource tables, binary XML files, and processed
/// PNG files and packages them into a single APK. Additionally, other auxiliary
/// files like `R.java` and ProGuard rules files can be generated during this phase.
/// However, the generated APK does not contain DEX bytecode and is unsigned.
/// That is, you can't deploy this APK to a device. If you're not using the Android
/// Gradle Plugin to [`build your app from the command line`], you can use other command
/// line tools, such as [`d8`] to compile Java bytecode into DEX bytecode and
/// [`apksigner`] to sign your APK.
///
/// ## Link syntax
/// The general syntax for using link is as follows:
///
/// ```
/// aapt2 link path-to-input-files [options] -o
/// outputdirectory/outputfilename.apk --manifest AndroidManifest.xml
/// ```
///
/// In the following example, AAPT2 merges the two intermediate files -
/// `drawable_Image.flat` and `values_values.arsc.flat`, and the `AndroidManifest.xml`
/// file. AAPT2 links the result against `android.jar` file which holds the resources
/// defined in the android package:
///
/// ```
///  aapt2 link -o output.apk
///  -I android_sdk/platforms/android_version/android.jar
///     compiled/res/values_values.arsc.flat
///     compiled/res/drawable_Image.flat --manifest /path/to/AndroidManifest.xml -v
/// ```
